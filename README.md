# Young Volunteers · Reading v3

Separate reading-only edition. The previous reading-v2 project is not modified.

Flow: Lead-in → synchronized Learning Objectives on teacher and student screens → vocabulary line match → Hot Potato with a six-word Word Bank → START READING → skim → Example 0 (Key Idea) → group Key Ideas → Example 0 (Text Bridge) → group Text Bridge and Who → ring peer check (Approve / Revise only) → teacher reveals one-question comparisons and six-group result cards → Recapture → h/i exit ticket → Matching Superpowers.

The formal warm-up follows the approved preview designs in `presentation-simplification-comparison.html` and `lead-vocab-reading-flow-preview.html`: photo-and-prompt Lead-in, deliberately crossed vocabulary matching with animated reveal lines, six large Hot Potato sentences with two answers revealed per round, and a teacher-controlled START READING handoff. The check-in shows which group tablets are online, but the teacher can press START CLASS at any attendance count; missing groups may join later.

Five groups: Groups 1–4 handle a–d; Group 5 handles e and f. Teacher example: g. Exit: h/i. Current revised reading text is preserved.

Run: Node 20+, npm install, npm start. Set PORT if needed.
Render: create a NEW service linked to a NEW repository; Root Directory blank, Build npm install, Start npm start, Health /health. Do not update the older services.
Upload the files and public folder after extracting the complete ZIP; do not upload the ZIP or an outer folder.

Teacher: /teacher.html. Student: /student.html?room=CODE. QR: /join.html?room=CODE.
Students and guests wait while the teacher runs the warm-up. Their tablets open SKIM automatically after START READING. Guest practice is separate from class results.
Class records remain in server memory: server restart/reset can clear classroom data. Export PDFs before restarting.
The teacher can download a class snapshot from Recapture onward, before revealing the Exit Ticket. This snapshot excludes unpublished Exit Ticket answers. Paper Exit Tickets can be collected and checked separately. If the web Exit Ticket is used, download another PDF after submissions and answer reveal. A room with no connected tablets is removed after six hours of inactivity; Render restarts can also clear it, so the web Exit Ticket is not guaranteed to remain available the next day.

Reading v3b: strict hidden-section rules; original option numbers (Example 3); compact progress and peer check; comma/punctuation evidence fragments without printed sentence IDs; highlighted original evidence beside matching explanations; prominent WHY.
Points appear after teacher reveal. Key Ideas: 10 per correct answer; Bridge: 30 for a complete correct match; Exit: 20 per correct answer. Fully correct groups earn speed bonuses up to 3 based on elapsed time in each phase. Guest practice does not enter the class ranking.


Live leaderboard: teacher and student screens animate after Skim, Key Ideas, and the reading/peer-check reveal, then Exit Ticket. The teacher clicks SHOW ANSWERS to move directly into answer discussion. Uses actual shared group submissions, correct peer judgments, reveal-only scoring and approved plush avatars. Duplicate state updates and refresh do not award extra points or replay an already-viewed round.

Recommended interface: English carries the academic task; short Chinese text only supports an action. Key Idea review shows one question at a time and directly compares the group selection with the reference answer. The student Peer Check uses the approved single-card design: fixed order, Question + Key Idea, Text Bridge, Who, then two large Approve / Revise choices. The teacher answer review shows `THEIR SELECTION → REFERENCE ANSWER → KEY IDEA` with consistent purple, teal, coral and green colours; Who is checked separately. Recapture keeps Key Ideas as its first step. Question f keeps its original displayed Key Idea.
